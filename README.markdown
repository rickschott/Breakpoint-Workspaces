# Breakpoint Workspaces

Breakpoint Workspaces is a Visual Studio Add-In that manages breakpoint groups in an external text file. 
You can save a set of breakpoints and give it a name that relates to some kind of process you may be working on(bug numbers..etc). 
You can then load them at will to debug hassle free. Great for digging back into something you may have been working on 6 months ago.
